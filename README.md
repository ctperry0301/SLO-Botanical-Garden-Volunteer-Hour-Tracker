### Overview
The following sections contain a summary of the project, its purpose, who it serves, and who created it.

#### Purpose
The purpose of this application was to improve the volunteer tracking process at the SLO Botanical Garden nonprofit. Previously, volunteer information was written down and manually inputted into spreadsheets by nonprofit supervisors. In order to streamline this arduous task, the team built a volunteer management system that allows volunteers to record their hours and view their volunteer history, all while allowing nonprofit supervisors to keep this information and filter/export it when necessary. 

#### Team
The SLO Botanical Garden project team consisted of 5 Cal Poly Computer Science students. Over the course of 8 months, they worked in collaboration to develop and deploy this web application. The team can be seen below:
